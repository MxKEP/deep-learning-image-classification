Deep Learning Architectures for Image Classification

As we progress in the information age computer vision becomes ever more popular. Image
classification, a fundamental task of computer vision, has applications in many fields such as the
automotive industry, medical field, manufacturing, and many more. Since the vast amount of
image data we obtain from cameras and sensors is unstructured, we depend on advanced
techniques such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze the images
efficiently (Boesch, 2022). Image classification is the process of predicting what the image is of
and can be done by analyzing each of its pixels individually. This problem is well-suited towards
deep learning. Several deep learning techniques such as the Multilayer Perceptron,
Convolutional Neural Network, and Transfer Learning will be trained for image classification
and evaluated by their accuracy in this report.
